# caImageAnalysis
calcium imaging functional analysis


pipeline leverages caiman for image motion correction and suite2p for source extraction (caiman can also be used for this)


<br>


core: motion correction, source extraction, calculate factors <br> 

utils: ideally things used multiple places, converts timestamps, stimuli, etc into dataframes <br> 

visualize: various visualization of response-classes, barcodes, neuron functions, etc <br>
