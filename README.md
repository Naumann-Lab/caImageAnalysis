# caImageAnalysis
calcium imaging functional analysis


pipeline leverages caiman for image motion correction and suite2p for source extraction (caiman can also be used for this)

core: motion correction, source extraction, calculate factors
utils: ideally things used multiple places, converts timestamps, stimuli, etc into dataframes
visualize: various visualization of response-classes, barcodes, neuron functions, etc
